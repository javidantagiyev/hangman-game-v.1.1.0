<h2>Hangman Game</h2>  

Welcome to the Hangman game! ðŸŽ®

This is a classic Hangman game (I wrote it a few years ago) implemented in Python. Try to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. If you miss too many, you'll lose! Enjoy the game and see how many words you can guess correctly.


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
